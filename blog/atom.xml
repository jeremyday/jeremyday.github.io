<p>I finally got around to summiting Mount Rosa. I started at 4:20 in the morning at the parking lot at the bottom of Cheyenne Mountain Canyon and finished 8 hours, 25 miles, and 6,725 feet of climbing later. I was expecting closer to 23 miles, and those extra couple of miles were rough, as I needed to stretch my water more than expected. I'm still getting used to long mountain adventures, and I told my wife I thought I  might be done at 10:00. I felt bad about being completely wrong, but I had my phone with me and had turned on my Spot tracker, so she knew where I was okay.</p>]]></content>

<p>Well, this did not go according to plan. I started getting a migraine at the <a href="https://your-docusaurus-test-site.com/docs/races/maces-hideout-100#aid-station-3">Greenhorn Aid Station</a> at mile 18.3. That's the second highest point on the course. On the way down the mountain it mostly went away, but it came roaring back around <a href="https://your-docusaurus-test-site.com/docs/races/maces-hideout-100#aid-station-5">Pole Creek</a> at the bottom of the mountain. I pushed on to <a href="https://your-docusaurus-test-site.com/docs/races/maces-hideout-100#aid-station-6">Sand Hollow</a> at mile 37.7, but I was experiencing some dizziness. I decided I didn't want to risk vertigo further up the mountain, since Sand Hollow was pretty much the lowest point on the course, so I called it a day. Right after I dropped the skies opened up and a cold, cold rain started falling.</p>

<p>I didn't actually run 50 miles. I was struggling pretty much out of the gate with energy to my legs. I'm not sure why, because I think I fueled properly. I didn't sleep much Friday night because I had that anxious tick where I was afraid I was going to miss my alarm, even though there were three other adults in the house where I stayed who would be getting up for the race.</p>

<p>I didn't actually get to run the <strong><a href="https://your-docusaurus-test-site.com/docs/races/royal-gorge-groove-50k#race-details">Royal Gorge Groove 50k</a></strong>. <strong><a href="https://your-docusaurus-test-site.com/docs/terms/s#snow">Snow</a></strong> came in overnight and it was blowing <em>way</em> harder than expected when I left the house at 5:50 AM. I couldn't use my brights, because the <strong><a href="https://your-docusaurus-test-site.com/docs/terms/s#snow">snow</a></strong> just reflected the light back at me, like fog. Once I got south of Fort Carson heading towards Cañon City the roads turned to absolute shit. I'm talking drive-30-miles-per-hour-and-not-see-the-road-stripes shit. So I turned around, which involved some <strong><a href="https://your-docusaurus-test-site.com/docs/terms/i#ice">ice</a></strong> sliding when I slowed down further to turn onto a side street, and went home. I didn't feel even a little bit bad about missing the race, even though I was looking forward to a good run.</p>

<p>I dropped my so off at school and then headed up into the mountains to attempt an ascent of <strong><a href="https://www.alltrails.com/explore/trail/us/colorado/cheyenne-canyon-to-mt-rosa" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mount Rosa</a></strong>. The forecast called for rain and snow later in the day, and it was mostly overcast when I got to the trailhead. Fortunately temperatures were pretty cool and there was no precipitation when I started. I had some trepidation about hitting potential weather on the mountain, but I was prepared to turn around early if things started looking nasty.</p>
<p>The first 1.2 miles are along Gold Camp Road, which is just a dirt road at this point. The incline is easy and I was able to run pretty much everything. Then the road turns sharply to the right and the real trail begins.</p>
<p>Along this stretch I was able to do some running, but mostly I just fast-hiked. I warmed up pretty quickly, so I stashed my shell in my pack and went in just my t-shirt. At the start the trees were hard up on the trail on both sides and the view was pretty obstructed. A couple of miles up the trail I came across <strong><a href="https://www.alltrails.com/explore/trail/us/colorado/st-marys-falls-trail?mobileMap=false&amp;ref=sidebar-static-map" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">St. Mary's Falls</a></strong>. Unfortunately it was mostly frozen and not very scenic at this time of year. I'll need to go back some other time.</p>
<p>After St. Mary's Falls the trail started getting steeper. At about four miles in it got steeper still and started to get pretty technical. There were some stretches that were pretty steep, and I was pushing the pace enough that I could feel my pulse in my ears. That's always a sign to slow down a bit.</p>
<p>It started getting much colder as I got to 10,000 feet and higher, so I went ahead and pulled my shell back on. I had gloves and a beanie hat with me, but it never got cold enough for those.</p>
<p>The last half mile of the trail started to get more and more <strong><a href="https://your-docusaurus-test-site.com/docs/terms/s#snow">snow</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://your-docusaurus-test-site.com/docs/terms/i#ice">ice</a></strong>. I did not have my <strong><a href="https://your-docusaurus-test-site.com/docs/terms/s#spikes">spikes</a></strong>, so I was careful through these sections. Fortunately they were not all that long. Mostly it was crunchy old snow, with only a few sections of really slick ice. That all changed when I got to the saddle before the final push up to Mount Rosa. Up there, around 11,000 feet, the snow got thick, particularly in the direction of Mount Rosa. It was thick enough and there were few enough tracks that I could not make out the trail up to Mount Rosa. I was a little bummed, but I still got 3,500 feet of climbing at that point, so I decided to head back down. After a careful-but-quick mile of steep, highly technical, sometimes snowy and icy trail I was able to speed up a bit. I also started warming up, so I stashed the shell again.</p>
<p>I stopped to take a few pictures on the way down, but in general I was taking the descent nice and easy and consistent, which is exactly what I wanted. I was able to speed up more after a couple of miles when the trail became much less technical and I was able to stretch a bit. The final 1.2 miles along Gold Camp Road were gravy.</p>
<p>On the way down the mountain I started running through some snow. It was my first time running in snow in my shorts and t-shirt, which is apparently a Colorado thing. As I got lower on Gold Camp Road the snow turned into drizzle turned into rain. I finished my run a little damp, but not soaked.</p>
<p>Six miles of downhill really took it out of my legs. It was everything I hoped it would be, and I can't wait to get back for some more serious <strong><a href="https://your-docusaurus-test-site.com/docs/terms/v#vert">vert</a></strong> <strong><a href="https://your-docusaurus-test-site.com/docs/terms/t#training">training</a></strong>.</p>]]></content>

<p>I <strong><a href="https://your-docusaurus-test-site.com/docs/terms/v#volunteers">volunteered</a></strong> at this race in 2023, and it was a really well put together event. I volunteered at packet pickup on Friday, and Denise, the co-<strong><a href="https://your-docusaurus-test-site.com/docs/terms/r#race-director">race director</a></strong> really had her shit together. We set up in the <strong><a href="https://corunco.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Colorado Running Company</a></strong> and had a pretty steady influx of runners the entire time we were there.</p>
<p>On Saturday morning I met Justin, the other co-<strong><a href="https://your-docusaurus-test-site.com/docs/terms/r#race-director">race director</a></strong>, at the start line at 5:30 AM, and there were already a bunch of volunteers helping get things set up. I helped get the start/<strong><a href="https://your-docusaurus-test-site.com/docs/terms/f#finish-line">finish line</a></strong> and the <strong><a href="https://your-docusaurus-test-site.com/docs/terms/a#aid-station">aid station</a></strong> there set up and then we drove out to the one on-course <strong><a href="https://your-docusaurus-test-site.com/docs/terms/a#aid-station">aid station</a></strong> to get it up and running. Runners would hit that <strong><a href="https://your-docusaurus-test-site.com/docs/terms/a#aid-station">aid station</a></strong> twice per loop. The markings could have been a little better around the aid station to let runners know which way to go when they left, depending on the direction they came in on, but that's something to work on next year. I spent the rest of the morning there.</p>
