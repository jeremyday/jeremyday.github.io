        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I dropped my so off at school and then headed up into the mountains to attempt an ascent of <strong><a href="https://www.alltrails.com/explore/trail/us/colorado/cheyenne-canyon-to-mt-rosa" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mount Rosa</a></strong>. The forecast called for rain and snow later in the day, and it was mostly overcast when I got to the trailhead. Fortunately temperatures were pretty cool and there was no precipitation when I started. I had some trepidation about hitting potential weather on the mountain, but I was prepared to turn around early if things started looking nasty.</p><p>The first 1.2 miles are along Gold Camp Road, which is just a dirt road at this point. The incline is easy and I was able to run pretty much everything. Then the road turns sharply to the right and the real trail begins.</p><p>Along this stretch I was able to do some running, but mostly I just fast-hiked. I warmed up pretty quickly, so I stashed my shell in my pack and went in just my t-shirt. At the start the trees were hard up on the trail on both sides and the view was pretty obstructed. A couple of miles up the trail I came across <strong><a href="https://www.alltrails.com/explore/trail/us/colorado/st-marys-falls-trail?mobileMap=false&amp;ref=sidebar-static-map" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">St. Mary's Falls</a></strong>. Unfortunately it was mostly frozen and not very scenic at this time of year. I'll need to go back some other time.</p><p>After St. Mary's Falls the trail started getting steeper. At about four miles in it got steeper still and started to get pretty technical. There were some stretches that were pretty steep, and I was pushing the pace enough that I could feel my pulse in my ears. That's always a sign to slow down a bit.</p><p>It started getting much colder as I got to 10,000 feet and higher, so I went ahead and pulled my shell back on. I had gloves and a beanie hat with me, but it never got cold enough for those.</p><p>The last half mile of the trail started to get more and more <strong><a href="/docs/terms/s#snow">snow</a></strong> and <strong><a href="/docs/terms/i#ice">ice</a></strong>. I did not have my <strong><a href="/docs/terms/s#spikes">spikes</a></strong>, so I was careful through these sections. Fortunately they were not all that long. Mostly it was crunchy old snow, with only a few sections of really slick ice. That all changed when I got to the saddle before the final push up to Mount Rosa. Up there, around 11,000 feet, the snow got thick, particularly in the direction of Mount Rosa. It was thick enough and there were few enough tracks that I could not make out the trail up to Mount Rosa. I was a little bummed, but I still got 3,500 feet of climbing at that point, so I decided to head back down. After a careful-but-quick mile of steep, highly technical, sometimes snowy and icy trail I was able to speed up a bit. I also started warming up, so I stashed the shell again.</p><p>I stopped to take a few pictures on the way down, but in general I was taking the descent nice and easy and consistent, which is exactly what I wanted. I was able to speed up more after a couple of miles when the trail became much less technical and I was able to stretch a bit. The final 1.2 miles along Gold Camp Road were gravy.</p><p>On the way down the mountain I started running through some snow. It was my first time running in snow in my shorts and t-shirt, which is apparently a Colorado thing. As I got lower on Gold Camp Road the snow turned into drizzle turned into rain. I finished my run a little damp, but not soaked.</p><p>Six miles of downhill really took it out of my legs. It was everything I hoped it would be, and I can't wait to get back for some more serious <strong><a href="/docs/terms/v#vert">vert</a></strong> <strong><a href="/docs/terms/t#training">training</a></strong>.</p>]]></content>
