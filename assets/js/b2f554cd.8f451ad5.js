I couldn\'t use my brights, because the **[snow](/docs/terms/s#snow)** just reflected the light back at me, like fog. Once I got south of Fort Carson heading towards Ca\xf1on City the roads turned to absolute shit. I\'m talking drive-30-miles-per-hour-and-not-see-the-road-stripes shit. So I turned around, which involved some **[ice](/docs/terms/i#ice)** sliding when I slowed down further to turn onto a side street, and went home. I didn\'t feel even a little bit bad about missing the race, even though I was looking forward to a good run.\\n\\n\x3c!-- backlinks --\x3e\\n<Backlinks terms={[{ slug: \'docs/races/royal-gorge-groove-50k#race-reports\', text: \\"Race Reports\\", title: \\"Royal Gorge Groove 50k\\" }]} />"},{"id":"mount-rosa-ascent-attempt","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/mount-rosa-ascent-attempt","source":"@site/blog/2023-04-14-mount-rosa-ascent-attempt.mdx","title":"Mount Rosa Ascent Attempt","description":"Run Report","date":"2023-04-14T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"April 14, 2023","tags":[{"label":"coloradosprings","permalink":"/blog/tags/coloradosprings"},{"label":"mountains","permalink":"/blog/tags/mountains"},{"label":"trails","permalink":"/blog/tags/trails"}],"readingTime":3.175,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Jeremy Day","title":"Ultrarunner","url":"https://github.com/jeremyday","imageURL":"https://github.com/jeremyday.png","key":"jeremyday"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"mount-rosa-ascent-attempt","title":"Mount Rosa Ascent Attempt","authors":"jeremyday","tags":["coloradosprings","mountains","trails"]},"prevItem":{"title":"Royal Gorge Groove 50k Race Report","permalink":"/blog/royal-gorge-groove-50k-race-report"},"nextItem":{"title":"Rattler 50k Volunteer Report","permalink":"/blog/rattler-50k-volunteer-report"}},"content":"import Backlinks from \'@site/src/components/Backlink\';\\n\\n\\n## Run Report\\n\\nI dropped my so off at school and then headed up into the mountains to attempt an ascent of **[Mount Rosa](https://www.alltrails.com/explore/trail/us/colorado/cheyenne-canyon-to-mt-rosa)**. The forecast called for rain and snow later in the day, and it was mostly overcast when I got to the trailhead. Fortunately temperatures were pretty cool and there was no precipitation when I started. I had some trepidation about hitting potential weather on the mountain, but I was prepared to turn around early if things started looking nasty.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\nThe first 1.2 miles are along Gold Camp Road, which is just a dirt road at this point. The incline is easy and I was able to run pretty much everything. Then the road turns sharply to the right and the real trail begins.\\n\\nAlong this stretch I was able to do some running, but mostly I just fast-hiked. I warmed up pretty quickly, so I stashed my shell in my pack and went in just my t-shirt. At the start the trees were hard up on the trail on both sides and the view was pretty obstructed. A couple of miles up the trail I came across **[St. Mary\'s Falls](https://www.alltrails.com/explore/trail/us/colorado/st-marys-falls-trail?mobileMap=false&ref=sidebar-static-map)**. Unfortunately it was mostly frozen and not very scenic at this time of year. I\'ll need to go back some other time.\\n\\nAfter St. Mary\'s Falls the trail started getting steeper. At about four miles in it got steeper still and started to get pretty technical. There were some stretches that were pretty steep, and I was pushing the pace enough that I could feel my pulse in my ears. That\'s always a sign to slow down a bit.\\n\\nIt started getting much colder as I got to 10,000 feet and higher, so I went ahead and pulled my shell back on. I had gloves and a beanie hat with me, but it never got cold enough for those.\\n\\nThe last half mile of the trail started to get more and more **[snow](/docs/terms/s#snow)** and **[ice](/docs/terms/i#ice)**. I did not have my **[spikes](/docs/terms/s#spikes)**, so I was careful through these sections. Fortunately they were not all that long. Mostly it was crunchy old snow, with only a few sections of really slick ice. That all changed when I got to the saddle before the final push up to Mount Rosa. Up there, around 11,000 feet, the snow got thick, particularly in the direction of Mount Rosa. It was thick enough and there were few enough tracks that I could not make out the trail up to Mount Rosa. I was a little bummed, but I still got 3,500 feet of climbing at that point, so I decided to head back down. After a careful-but-quick mile of steep, highly technical, sometimes snowy and icy trail I was able to speed up a bit. I also started warming up, so I stashed the shell again.\\n\\nI stopped to take a few pictures on the way down, but in general I was taking the descent nice and easy and consistent, which is exactly what I wanted. I was able to speed up more after a couple of miles when the trail became much less technical and I was able to stretch a bit. The final 1.2 miles along Gold Camp Road were gravy.\\n\\nOn the way down the mountain I started running through some snow. It was my first time running in snow in my shorts and t-shirt, which is apparently a Colorado thing. As I got lower on Gold Camp Road the snow turned into drizzle turned into rain. I finished my run a little damp, but not soaked.\\n\\nSix miles of downhill really took it out of my legs. It was everything I hoped it would be, and I can\'t wait to get back for some more serious **[vert](/docs/terms/v#vert)** **[training](/docs/terms/t#training)**."},{"id":"rattler-50k-volunteer-report","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/rattler-50k-volunteer-report","source":"@site/blog/2023-04-08-rattler-50k-volunteer-report.mdx","title":"Rattler 50k Volunteer Report","description":"Volunteer Report","date":"2023-04-08T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"April 8, 2023","tags":[{"label":"coloradosprings","permalink":"/blog/tags/coloradosprings"},{"label":"mountains","permalink":"/blog/tags/mountains"},{"label":"trails","permalink":"/blog/tags/trails"},{"label":"race","permalink":"/blog/tags/race"},{"label":"50k","permalink":"/blog/tags/50-k"}],"readingTime":0.965,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Jeremy Day","title":"Ultrarunner","url":"https://github.com/jeremyday","imageURL":"https://github.com/jeremyday.png","key":"jeremyday"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"rattler-50k-volunteer-report","title":"Rattler 50k Volunteer Report","authors":"jeremyday","tags":["coloradosprings","mountains","trails","race","50k"]},"prevItem":{"title":"Mount Rosa Ascent Attempt","permalink":"/blog/mount-rosa-ascent-attempt"}},"content":"import Backlinks from \'@site/src/components/Backlink\';\\n\\n\\n## Volunteer Report\\n\\nI **[volunteered](/docs/terms/v#volunteers)** at this race in 2023, and it was a really well put together event. I volunteered at packet pickup on Friday, and Denise, the co-**[race director](/docs/terms/r#race-director)** really had her shit together. We set up in the **[Colorado Running Company](https://corunco.com/)** and had a pretty steady influx of runners the entire time we were there.\\n\\nOn Saturday morning I met Justin, the other co-**[race director](/docs/terms/r#race-director)**, at the start line at 5:30 AM, and there were already a bunch of volunteers helping get things set up. I helped get the start/**[finish line](/docs/terms/f#finish-line)** and the **[aid station](/docs/terms/a#aid-station)** there set up and then we drove out to the one on-course **[aid station](/docs/terms/a#aid-station)** to get it up and running. Runners would hit that **[aid station](/docs/terms/a#aid-station)** twice per loop. The markings could have been a little better around the aid station to let runners know which way to go when they left, depending on the direction they came in on, but that\'s something to work on next year. I spent the rest of the morning there.\\n\\n\x3c!-- backlinks --\x3e\\n<Backlinks terms={[{ slug: \'docs/races/rattler-50k#race-reports\', text: \\"Race Reports\\", title: \\"Rattler 50k\\" }]} />"}]}')}}]);
